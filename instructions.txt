NOTE: If you already have a newer iTunes version you need to uninstall
and erase all instances of the program to include Bonjour and any Apple
application that installs with Itunes...you must also delete any and all
possible registry keys and hidden folders and any iTunes backups

**************************************************************************
WARNING: MAKE SURE YOU TURN OFF ANY SANDBOX PROGRAMS LIKE TIMEFREEZE OR
SANDBOXIE TO PREVENT BRICKING THE IPAD
**************************************************************************

This is a oldie but goodie. I originally jailbroke my iPad 1st generation
back  in 2011-2012 and since then have upgraded and also lost interest in
Apple products, but I have tons of .ipa games I've downloaded and wanted to
play again, so I got a nice MINT condition iPad 1 Gen on ebay and looked
through all my backups for the files needed. Below is the easy 2019 steps
for you to jailbreak the iOS 5.1.1. in case you wanted to do the same.

**************************************************************************
WARNING: AVOID LOOPING OR BRICKING
**************************************************************************
To prevent a loop or bricking situation (as I did when testing these steps)
DO NOT install any iPod packages to the iPad like programs that enhance iPod
games/apps to be used in the iPad screen. Also, make sure that NOTHING will
stop the jailbraking process or that your computer will crash when doing any
of the steps here or you'll end up with a +4hour frustration.

If you do then try the following:

- If brick or looped...run redsn0w 0.9.10b3/6 or10 9as admin but DO NOT set
  into DFU mode...just start it but don't do anything else
- Turn off the iPad then connect to PC on USB 2.0 not USB 3.0 or viceversa
  to make iTunes recognize it
- Let it download restore update through iTunes
- If fail turn off iTunes then restart and go to ipda > restore and let it
finish


STEP #1: Downloads
===========================================================================
1. Download:
	· Absinthe-win 2.0.4...scan for viruses!
	· Install iTunes...it doesn't matter if its the latest iTunes
	· Cydia Impactor...scan for viruses!
	· iTunes 11 (64bit...89MB)

2. Unzip Absinthe to the Desktop and run the program...a cmd prompt will
show and a folder with the same name is now created

3. Connect the iPad then run the .exe in Absinthe...let it finish and
DO NOT TOUCH IT!

4. When done, slide the screen to the left and find CYDIA...move it
to the main screen if you want to


STEP #2: Sources (optional)
===========================================================================
1. Make sure the iPad is connected to your router and run CYDIA

2. When asked only update the ESSENTIALS

3. Select SOURCES > EDIT and delete repor666.ultrasn0w.com
